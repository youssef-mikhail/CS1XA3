## Part 1: Webpage CV

A free to use open-source template (under MIT license) was used for this website. The original template can be found [here](https://startbootstrap.com/themes/resume/).

The modifications made to this template include the use of parallax scrolling, which allows a background to stay
stationary in the background for each section of the CV (all pictures, with the exception of McMaster University's campus,
were taken by me). Each resume section was also enclosed in a Bootstrap provided "jumbotron", so that the text could be
read over the backgrounds. The automatic scrolling to resume sections upon clicking a link in the sidebar was implemented
using the JQuery Easing framework. A final adjustment was made to make the webpage more responsive to smaller screen sizes,
which reduced the size of titles and subheadings to allow them to look better on smaller screens.
